## Review Categories

### 1. Dockerfile Best Practices

**Check for**:

- Multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Layer ordering (dependencies before source code)
- Base image selection (distroless > alpine > debian)
- .dockerignore excluding secrets, node_modules, .git
- Combined RUN commands to reduce layers
- Non-root USER directive
- COPY vs ADD (prefer COPY)
- Pinned base image versions

```dockerfile
# ❌ Common issues
FROM python:latest                    # Unpinned version
COPY . /app                           # Before dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt   # Cache invalidated every change
USER root                             # Running as root

# ❌ Dependencies stay behind in the builder stage
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # Builder's environment only

FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot
COPY --from=builder /app /app  # Source only: ModuleNotFoundError at runtime

# ✅ Correct pattern
# Build with the interpreter the runtime image ships: distroless
# python3-debian13 provides CPython 3.13 at /usr/bin/python3.13.
FROM python:3.13-slim-trixie AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --target=/deps -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian13:nonroot
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /deps /deps
COPY --from=builder /app /app
ENV PYTHONPATH=/deps
USER nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/python3.13", "-m", "app"]
```

A distroless runtime has no shell and no `pip`, so it can only use packages
copied from the builder. `pip install --target` plus `PYTHONPATH` is the
smallest form of this; a virtual environment also works, but its `bin/python`
is a symlink to the builder's interpreter, so the container still has to be
started through the runtime image's own interpreter. Wheels containing compiled
extensions **MUST** be built for the same interpreter version, libc and
architecture as the runtime image, which is why both stages use Debian 13.

**Severity**:

- 🔴 **Critical**: Running as root, unpinned base images, secrets in layers
- 🔴 **Critical**: Runtime stage missing the installed dependencies
- 🟡 **Warning**: Missing multi-stage, poor layer ordering, missing .dockerignore
- 🟡 **Warning**: Builder and runtime interpreter versions differ
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Base image optimization, combining RUN commands

---

### 2. Image Pinning

**Check for**:

- SHA256 digest pinning (not just tags)
- Multi-architecture digest tracking for ARM64/AMD64
- Version comments alongside digests
- Mutable tag usage (`:latest`, `:stable`)

```yaml
# ❌ Tags are mutable
services:
  api:
    image: nginx:latest
    image: nginx:1.25

# ✅ Digest pinning
services:
  api:
    # nginx:1.25.3, pinned 2024-11
    image: nginx@sha256:4c0fdaa8b6341bfdeca5f18f7837462c80cff90527ee35ef185571e1c327beac
```

**Multi-Architecture Pattern**:

```yaml
# images.yml for mixed ARM64/AMD64 deployments
images:
  traefik:
    version: "3.6.5"
    pinned_at: "2025-12-24"
    digests:
      amd64: "sha256:d944e3693bbf5a..."
      arm64: "sha256:088e42947073..."
```

**Severity**:

- 🔴 **Critical**: Using `:latest` in production
- 🟡 **Warning**: Using tags instead of digests
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add version comments, use images.yml for multi-arch

---

### 3. Security Hardening

**Check for**:

- `no-new-privileges:true` security option
- `cap_drop: [ALL]` with selective `cap_add`
- Non-root user (`user: "1000:1000"`)
- Read-only root filesystem with tmpfs
- Docker secrets (not environment variables)
- Resource limits (memory, CPU, PIDs)
- No `privileged: true` (except specialized containers)

```yaml
# ❌ Security issues
services:
  app:
    privileged: true                    # Full host access
    environment:
      - DB_PASSWORD=supersecret         # Visible in inspect
    # No security_opt, no cap_drop

# ✅ Hardened configuration
services:
  app:
    user: "1000:1000"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /var/run
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE                # Only if needed
    secrets:
      - db_password
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: '1'
          pids: 100
```

**Severity**:

- 🔴 **Critical**: `privileged: true`, secrets in env vars, running as root
- 🟡 **Warning**: Missing `no-new-privileges`, missing `cap_drop`, no resource limits
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add read-only filesystem, use tmpfs

---

### 4. Health Checks

**Check for**:

- Health checks defined for all services
- Appropriate intervals and timeouts
- `start_period` for slow-starting services
- `start_interval` for faster startup checks (Compose 2.23+)
- Proper health check commands (wget vs curl)
- `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`

```yaml
# ❌ Missing or incomplete health checks
services:
  api:
    depends_on:
      - database                        # Only start order, not readiness
    # No healthcheck defined

# ✅ Complete health check configuration
services:
  api:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "--spider", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
      start_interval: 2s
    depends_on:
      database:
        condition: service_healthy
        restart: true
```

**Severity**:

- 🟡 **Warning**: Missing health checks, `depends_on` without conditions
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add `start_interval`, use wget for Alpine images

---

### 5. Compose Organization

**Check for**:

- YAML anchors (`x-` fragments) to reduce duplication
- `include` directive for modular stacks
- Per-service subdirectories for config files
- Appropriate volume strategy (Docker volumes vs bind mounts)
- Environment-specific overrides

```yaml
# ❌ Duplication and flat structure
services:
  api:
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "50m"
  worker:
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: "50m"

# ✅ DRY with fragments
x-service-defaults: &service-defaults
  restart: unless-stopped
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  cap_drop:
    - ALL

x-logging: &logging
  driver: json-file
  options:
    max-size: "50m"
    max-file: "5"

services:
  api:
    <<: *service-defaults
    logging:
      <<: *logging
  worker:
    <<: *service-defaults
    logging:
      <<: *logging
```

**Directory Structure**:

```text
stacks/platform/
├── compose.yml
├── traefik/
│   ├── traefik.yml
│   └── config/
├── prometheus/
│   └── prometheus.yml
```

**Severity**:

- 🟡 **Warning**: Significant duplication without fragments
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Use `include` for modularity, per-service directories

---

### 6. Networking

**Check for**:

- Internal networks for backend services
- External networks for cross-stack communication
- IP-bound ports (not `0.0.0.0`)
- Network isolation between frontend/backend

```yaml
# ❌ Networking issues
services:
  database:
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"                     # Exposed to all interfaces
    networks:
      - default                         # Same network as frontend

# ✅ Proper network isolation
networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    internal: true                      # No external access

services:
  api:
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
  database:
    networks:
      - backend                         # Not directly accessible
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"          # Localhost only
      # Or: "${TAILSCALE_IP:-127.0.0.1}:5432:5432"
```

**Severity**:

- 🟡 **Warning**: Database exposed to all interfaces, missing internal networks
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Use IP-bound ports, external networks for cross-stack

---

### 7. Logging

**Check for**:

- Log rotation configured (max-size, max-file)
- Structured JSON logging
- Appropriate log levels per environment
- Prometheus/Loki labels for discovery

```yaml
# ❌ Missing log rotation
services:
  api:
    # No logging configuration (unbounded logs!)

# ✅ Proper log configuration
x-logging: &logging
  driver: json-file
  options:
    max-size: "50m"
    max-file: "5"

services:
  api:
    logging:
      <<: *logging
    labels:
      - "logging=promtail"
```

**Severity**:

- 🟡 **Warning**: Missing log rotation (can fill disk)
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add structured logging, discovery labels

---

### 8. Labels & Metadata

**Check for**:

- Prometheus discovery labels for metrics
- Traefik labels for routing (if applicable)
- OCI image labels for metadata
- Environment/team labels for organization

```yaml
services:
  api:
    labels:
      # Prometheus discovery
      - "prometheus.io/scrape=true"
      - "prometheus.io/port=8080"
      - "prometheus.io/path=/metrics"
      # Metadata
      - "org.opencontainers.image.version=1.0.0"
      - "com.example.team=platform"
```

**Severity**:

- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add discovery labels, OCI metadata

---

### 9. Graceful Shutdown

**Check for**:

- `init: true` for proper signal handling
- `stop_grace_period` for clean shutdown
- Application handles SIGTERM

```yaml
# ✅ Graceful shutdown configuration
services:
  api:
    init: true                          # Proper PID 1 behavior
    stop_grace_period: 30s              # Time before SIGKILL
  database:
    stop_grace_period: 60s              # Databases need more time
```

**Severity**:

- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add `init: true`, configure grace period

---

### 10. Image Scanning

**Check for**:

- Trivy or equivalent scanning in CI
- Critical/High vulnerability thresholds
- Hadolint for Dockerfile linting

Third-party Actions run with access to the workflow token and secrets, so they
**MUST** be pinned to a full-length commit SHA that you have reviewed: tags and
branches are mutable and can be repointed at new code without warning.

```yaml
# ❌ Mutable reference - the action's code can change under you
- name: Scan image
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master

# ✅ CI integration (.github/workflows/build.yml)
permissions:
  contents: read  # Least privilege at workflow level

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Scan image
        # aquasecurity/trivy-action v0.36.0, released 2026-04-22
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@ed142fd0673e97e23eac54620cfb913e5ce36c25
        with:
          image-ref: myapp:1.0
          severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
          exit-code: 1

      - name: Lint Dockerfile
        run: hadolint Dockerfile
```

**Severity**:

- 🔴 **Critical**: Third-party Action referenced by branch or tag
- 🟡 **Warning**: No vulnerability scanning in CI
- 🔵 **Suggestion**: Add Hadolint for Dockerfile linting

---

## Example Review

```markdown
## Docker Review: Platform Stack

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Review Effort** | 3/5 |
| **Risk Level** | High |
| **Files Reviewed** | 1 Dockerfile, 2 Compose files |

### 🔴 Critical (must fix before deploy)

- [ ] **Security**: Database password in environment variable (`compose.yml:24`)

  **Before**:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecret
  ```

  **After**:

  ```yaml
  secrets:
    - db_password
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db_password
  ```

  **Why**: Environment variables visible in `docker inspect`. Use Docker secrets.
  [See: Doctrine Docker Guide - Secrets](docker.md#docker-secrets-vs-environment-variables)

- [ ] **Security**: Running as root (`Dockerfile:15`)

  **Before**:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.12-slim
  COPY . /app
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

  **After**:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.12-slim
  RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
  COPY --chown=appuser . /app
  USER appuser
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

  **Why**: Root in container increases attack surface if container is compromised.

### 🟡 Warning (should fix)

- [ ] **Image Pinning**: Using tag instead of digest (`compose.yml:8`)

  Use `nginx@sha256:...` instead of `nginx:1.25.3`

- [ ] **Health Checks**: Missing health check for api service (`compose.yml:12`)

  Add healthcheck with appropriate interval/timeout.

- [ ] **Resources**: No memory/CPU limits defined (`compose.yml:12-20`)

  Add deploy.resources.limits to prevent resource exhaustion.

### 🔵 Suggestion (consider)

- [ ] **Organization**: Duplicate security config across services

  Extract to `x-service-defaults` fragment.

- [ ] **Logging**: No log rotation configured

  Add logging driver with max-size/max-file options.

### ✅ Positive Observations

- ✓ Multi-stage build reduces image size
- ✓ Internal network isolates database
- ✓ .dockerignore excludes sensitive files

### Summary

High-risk configuration with secrets exposed in environment variables and root user.
Fix critical security issues before deployment. Good foundation with multi-stage
builds and network isolation.
